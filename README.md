## 👤 Agent Lifecycle

### 🧪 1. Deploy a New Agent

```clojure
(deploy-agent name strategy-type initial-capital loss-tolerance)
````

* Mints a new AI Agent NFT
* Registers strategy and initializes weights
* Transfers initial capital and fees to contract

---

### ♻️ 2. Rebalance Capital

```clojure
(rebalance-position agent-id new-protocol allocation-percentage)
```

* Must be called after cooldown
* Updates strategy allocations
* Neural weights are adjusted based on PnL

---

### ⏸ 3. Pause an Agent

```clojure
(pause-agent agent-id)
```

* Temporarily deactivates trading
* Protects during volatile market events

---

### 💸 4. Withdraw Funds

```clojure
(withdraw-from-agent agent-id amount)
```

* Withdraws funds minus performance fees
* Adjusts capital and position state

---

### 🧠 5. Train AI Agent

```clojure
(train-agent agent-id performance-data)
```

* Updates neural weights based on recent market data
* Simple backpropagation-like update with `learning-rate`

---

## 📊 Strategy Performance

```clojure
(get-strategy-metrics strategy)
```

Returns:

* `total-deployed`
* `total-profits`
* `success-rate`
* `avg-apy`
* `risk-score`

All dynamically updated based on agent activity.

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `get-agent agent-id`                        | Returns AI agent details                               |
| `get-user-agents principal`                 | Lists agent IDs owned by user                          |
| `calculate-optimal-allocation capital risk` | Suggests capital split between safe and volatile pools |

---

## 🔒 Safety Mechanisms

* Cooldown enforcement on rebalance
* Max agent cap per user
* Performance-based neural weight adjustment
* Profit-loss tracking for APY and risk scoring
* Emergency pause for agents
* Withdrawal validation against deployed capital

---

## 📈 Neural Engine Overview

Each AI agent is powered by:

* A `list 10 uint` representing its **neural weights**
* A `learning-rate` from 1–20
* Training functions that use simplified gradient-like updates
* On-chain adaptability to improve performance over time

> Agents can rebalance, hedge, pause, and optimize across multiple protocols while learning from past trades.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Suggestions)

* Add real-time oracle price feeds
* Support for compound, sBTC, USDA-based pools
* Cross-chain deployment for Layer 2 rollups
* Agent reputation leaderboard
* Agent DAO coordination for collaborative training

---

## 🧠 Terminology

* **Agent ID**: Unique identifier for each AI agent NFT
* **Neural Weights**: On-chain learnable parameters
* **Strategy Type**: e.g., "stable-yield", "volatile-alpha"
* **PNL**: Profit and Loss in STX terms
* **Hedged**: Capital allocation made with reduced risk

## 🛠️ Contract Initialization

No explicit init function needed; all state variables like `total-agents` and `cumulative-profits` are initialized to `u0`.
